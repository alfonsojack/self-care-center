# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a "Self Care Center" that displays a random mantra or affirmation for the user, depending on their choice. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
A person would just have to go to my github, open my self-care-center repo, and clone it by copying the SSH link displayed after clicking the green "CODE" button on the top right area of the page. They would then go into their terminal, navigate to a directory they'd like to clone it into, type "git clone" then past that SSH link, then hit enter. Then they can open the repo, type "open index.html" and hit enter and they should be able to use the app. 

If they'd like to mess with the code in any way, they'd have to fork the repository before cloning it. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I worked consistently through one week, at least an hour a day and as many as 4 hours on multiple different days. I am roughly 3 weeks into Turing's 7 month program. This project allowed me to practice the JavaScript that I had been learning as well as the HTML and CSS concepts I had just been introduced to. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
I worked with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The goal was to match a provided screenshot comparison by writing CSS and HTML while using JavaScript to add event handling that would respond to user input. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I learned a lot about CSS and HTML. 
1. Building HTML and CSS on my own allowed me to understand the DOM much better and understand how the JavaScript I write interacts with everything else.
2. I learned a lot about form submission. The radio buttons in tandem with the submit button gave me a headache at first, and I wasn't sure how to best make the submit button respond to specific inputs, but a lot of reading helped me figure out how forms and buttons function. 
3. I learned a lot about CSS through copious trial and error. I feel much more comfortable with the concepts now.
